Inspired by [a few Tweets from

# Installation

??? TODO

# Usage

Run `pupsh`. Or change your shell to pupsh (with chsh), then open a new terminal.

# Development

Requires a working Rust toolchain, namely `rustc` and `cargo`.
After checking out the repo, run `cargo build` to install dependencies
and build it. To use it, run `./target/debug/pupsh` from the root of the repo.

TODO: Running tests? (Requires actually having tests.) Actual installation?
